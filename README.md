# Type-Destiny
A Highschool Sophomore Computer Science II final project. Using the QT Visual IDE based in C++, I created an interactive typing-combat game. You can view an in-depth overview of the documentation and design philosophies of this project [at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg_Cd2k9jVw "Documentation") or view a demo of the project [at this timestamp](https://youtu.be/jg_Cd2k9jVw?t=171) if you do not wish to view the introduction.
